#   in the form of:
#       num_of_rows
#       num_of_cols
#       columns
#       rows

# make an array that will hold arrasy: [[], [], [], ....] 
#       each inner array is a row
#           - these must all be the same length
# loop through the inputs from the command line. Inputs
#       num_of_rows
